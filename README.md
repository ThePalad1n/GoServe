Certainly! Here's the revised `README.md` for your GoServe app developed using Go:

```markdown
# GoServe

GoServe is a backend server fully developed in Go, tailored to provide robust database interactions for a social networking application. It facilitates communication between the app's frontend and the database, ensuring efficient handling of data operations and server-side logic.

## Configuration

To ensure GoServe functions correctly with your setup, configure your database credentials and network port as per your environment.

### Database Credentials

1. Identify the file within the project where database credentials are configured.
2. Replace the existing placeholders with your actual database credentials, including the username, password, and database name.
3. Confirm that the database user has the necessary permissions for the operations that the social app requires.

### Network Configuration

1. The server's network port is specified in a configuration file or as an environment variable.
2. If the default port is not suitable due to network conflicts or preferences, change it to an available port of your choosing.
3. Make sure the new port is not restricted and can accept connections on your network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goserve.git
cd goserve
```

2. Install any necessary Go dependencies:

```bash
go get ./...
```

3. Compile and run the server:

```bash
go build
./goserve
```

Alternatively, you can run the Go file directly:

```bash
go run main.go
```
